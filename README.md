## 📊 Data Overview

The dataset, sourced from [Kaggle Playground Series S4E10](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e10), contains features related to loan applications:
- 👤 **Applicant Information**: Age (`person_age`), income (`person_income`), employment length (`person_emp_length`), credit history length (`cb_person_cred_hist_length`).
- 💰 **Loan Details**: Amount (`loan_amnt`), interest rate (`loan_int_rate`), intent (`loan_intent`), percent of income (`loan_percent_income`), grade (`loan_grade`).
- 📜 **Other Factors**: Homeownership status (`person_home_ownership`), historical default status (`cb_person_default_on_file`).
- 🎯 **Target Variable**: `loan_status` (0: Approved, 1: Denied).

### Key Data Characteristics:
- 🧮 **Shape**: Train dataset has 58,645 rows and 12 columns.
- 🔑 **Notable Features**:
  - Higher incomes correlate with loan approvals.
  - Employment stability (length) significantly impacts decisions.

## ⚙️ MLOps Pipeline Workflow

### 1. **Data Ingestion** 📂
- **Script**: `data_injestion.py`
- **Process**:
  - Loaded `train.csv` and `test.csv` from `data/` directory.
  - Validated file existence and logged errors.
- **Output**: Train and test DataFrames with `id` as the index.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 📊
- **Performed**:
  - Identified trends (e.g., income vs. approval correlation).
  - Highlighted feature relationships using visualizations.
- **Visuals**:
  - Categorical features distribution.
  - Loan status distribution.
  - Loan intent analysis.

### 3. **Data Preprocessing** 🛠
- **Script**: `preprocess.py`
- **Process**:
  - **Categorical Mapping**:
    - `cb_person_default_on_file`: Y → 1, N → 0
    - `loan_grade`: A → 0, B → 1, ..., G → 6
  - **One-Hot Encoding**: Applied to `person_home_ownership` and `loan_intent` with `drop_first=True`.
  - **Log Transformation**: Applied to numerical features (`loan_amnt`, `loan_int_rate`, `person_income`, `person_age`, `person_emp_length`).
  - **Data Balancing**: Used SMOTEENN to handle class imbalance.
  - **Train-Validation Split**: Split data with 90% train, 10% validation (stratified).
  - **Scaling**: Standardized numerical features using `StandardScaler`, saved as `scaler.pkl`.
- **Output**: Saved preprocessed files (`X_train_scaled.csv`, `X_val_scaled.csv`, `y_train.csv`, `y_val.csv`, `test_data_scaled.csv`) in `data/`.

### 4. **Model Building and Training** 🤖
- **Script**: `train.py`
- **Process**:

    - 4 dense layers: 128, 64, 32, 16 units with ReLU activation.
    - Dropout layers (0.2) for regularization.
    - Output layer: 1 unit with sigmoid activation.
  - Compiled with Adam optimizer, binary cross-entropy loss, and accuracy metric.
  - Trained for 20 epochs with a batch size of 64.
  - Logged hyperparameters, metrics (e.g., val_loss, val_accuracy), and history to MLflow.
  - Saved the model as `models/loan_approval_model.keras`.
- **Output**: Trained model and MLflow logs.

### 5. **Model Evaluation** 📈
- **Script**: `evaluate.py`
- **Process**:
  - Evaluated on validation data with metrics:
    - Loss, Accuracy, AUC, Precision, Recall.

  - Logged confusion matrix and test predictions (`test_predictions.csv`) to MLflow.
- **Results**:
  - Achieved ~94% accuracy and F1-score (based on previous metrics).
  - Insights: Stable employment and low loan-to-income ratios improve approval chances.

### 6. **Model Registry** 📦
- **Script**: `register_model.py`
- **Process**:
  - Registered the trained model in MLflow with the name `LoanApprovalModel`.
  - Assigned alias `ReadyForProduction`.
  - Added tags (e.g., dataset: "Loan Dataset", model_type: "TensorFlow").
  - Included a description: "TensorFlow neural network for binary classification to predict loan approval outcomes."
- **Output**: Registered model version in MLflow.

### 7. **Pipeline Orchestration** 🎯
- **Script**: `pipeline.py`
- **Process**:
  - Orchestrated the entire workflow: preprocessing → training → registration → evaluation.
  - Logged each step and exceptions to `logs/app.log`.
- **Output**: Pipeline results with model version and metrics.

    1. 🏠 **Home**: Project overview and developer info.
    2. 📋 **Get Loan Approval**: Input form for individual predictions using the ANN.
    3. 📤 **Batch Prediction**: Upload CSV for bulk predictions.
    4. 💬 **LLM Analysis**:
       - Loan approval prediction using LLM (Mixtral-8x7B).
       - Customer review sentiment analysis (satisfied/dissatisfied).
  - Stored LLM predictions and reviews in `reviews.csv` with timestamps.
  - Integrated error handling and logging.
